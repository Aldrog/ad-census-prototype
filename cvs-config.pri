# Configuration of a build is determined by CONFIG variable, comment and uncomment
# entries as needed. Configurations can be added from command line, like
# qmake "CONFIG+=with_neon" cvs.pro


# This is a common section, anyway everybody is changing config.pri after checkout

# Open both lines to work with only one configuration that is chosen below.
# Such a config would have alone makefile at each working src dir.
#
#CONFIG -= debug_and_release
#CONFIG -= debug_and_release_target

# By generating VS projects only, neither debug nor release must be chosen!
# For makefiles we ask to generate both config makefiles and build only one chosen below config.
